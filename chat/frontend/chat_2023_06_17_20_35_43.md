1. **You**: </h/ead>
2. **ChatGPT**: It looks like you have written an HTML tag incorrectly. The correct tag should be `<head>`. HTML tags always begin with a less than symbol followed by the name of the tag, and end with a greater than symbol. Make sure you correct the spelling and use the correct syntax to avoid any errors.
